PLOT DESCRIPTIONS
_______________________________________________________________
Neutral 

mig_ld_fst_correlation.eps:
I calculated the correlation coefficient between ld and fst for each of the 100 simulations for every migration rate while holding divergence time constant.  Then, plotted a boxplot of those 100 values where the x-axis is each migration rate

div_ld_fst_correlation.eps:
I calculated the correlation coefficient between ld and fst for each of the 100 simulations for every divergence time while holding migration rate constant. Then, plotted a boxplot of those 100 values where the x-axis is each divergence time

mig_h2.eps:
for varying values of migration rate, I plotted the heritability estimate and the 95% CI as the error bar (calculated from the standard error given by ldsc in .h2 file)

mig_int.eps:
for varying values of migration rate, I plotted the intercept and the 95% CI as the error bar (calculated from the standard error given by ldsc in .h2 file)

div_h2.eps:
for varying values of divergence time, I plotted the heritability estimate and the 95% CI as the error bar (calculated from the standard error given by ldsc in .h2 file)

div_int.eps:
for varying values of divergence time, I plotted the intercept and the 95% CI as the error bar (calculated from the standard error given by ldsc in .h2 file)

Selection

pdsel_ld_fst_correlation.eps:
I calculated the correlation coefficient between ld and fst for each of the 100 simulations for every selection coefficient.  Then, plotted a boxplot of those 100 values where the x-axis is each selection coefficient

pdsel_h2.eps:
for varying values of selection coefficient, I plotted the heritability estimate and the 95% CI as the error bar (calculated from the standard error given by ldsc in .h2 file)

pdsel_h2_curve.eps:
for varying values of selection coefficient, I plotted the heritability estimate and the 95% CI as the error bar (calculated from the standard error given by ldsc in .h2 file) and then fit a curve to these values in order to later calculate the relative bias

pdsel_int.eps:
for varying values of selection coefficient, I plotted the intercept and the 95% CI as the error bar (calculated from the standard error given by ldsc in .h2 file)

relative_bias.eps:
By using the curve fit on the pdsel_h2_curve.eps plot, I calculated relative bias at the SNP level

h2fromsnp.eps: 
calculated the heritability of the trait that only came from the specified SNP 

relative_bias_and_h2SNP.pdf:
the last 2 plots (relative_bias.eps and h2fromsnp.eps) overlayed (used for space purposes on poster)
